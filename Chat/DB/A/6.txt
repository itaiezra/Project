Answare:
Single-dimensional arrays:	int[] numbers = new int[5];

Multidimensional arrays:	string[,] names = new string[5,4];

Array-of-arrays (jagged):	byte[][] scores = new byte[5][];
							for (int x = 0; x < scores.Length; x++) 
							{
								scores[x] = new byte[4];
							}

You can also have larger arrays. For example, you can have a three-dimensional rectangular array:

int[,,] buttons = new int[4,5,3];

You can even mix rectangular and jagged arrays. For example, the following code declares a single-dimensional array of three-dimensional arrays of two-dimensional arrays of type int:

int[][,,][,] numbers;
